This is a school project, where we have to create a Puzzle Bobble game.
The name is chosen simply because the guy who made the repository has an amazing sense of humor (or so he thinks), don't look too much into it.
If you take offense at the name, be informed that none of us actually give a damn about it and that you definitly lack a sense of humor.

Sincerely
The Puzzle Bitches team.
